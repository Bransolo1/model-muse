# Sensehub AutoM/L — One-page cheat sheet

**Four steps inside the app:** Upload → Choose what to predict → Optional settings → Run & results.

---

## 1. Upload

- Drop your spreadsheet (CSV) or use a sample.
- The app checks the file and shows a quick summary.

## 2. Choose what to predict

- Pick the column you want to predict (the **target**).
- Choose which columns to use as inputs (the **predictors**). The app can suggest these.

## 3. Optional settings

- Leave as-is for sensible defaults, or adjust quality vs. speed and advanced options if needed.

## 4. Run & results

- Run training. You get a **ranked list of models**, simple performance numbers, and **one-click export** to share or reproduce later.

**To run the app:** Open the project in RStudio, install packages once (see RUN_FROM_RSTUDIO.md), then run `source("run_app.R")` or Source `run_app.R`.
