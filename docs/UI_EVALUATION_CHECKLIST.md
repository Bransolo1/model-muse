# UI evaluation checklist — Sensehub AutoM/L

Use this while the app is running so you can evaluate and report back.

---

## 1. How to open the app

- **If a browser opened automatically:** You’re already there. The address is something like `http://127.0.0.1:XXXX` (port number may vary).
- **If not:** Open your browser and go to **http://127.0.0.1:3838** (or try **http://127.0.0.1:XXXX** if you see a port number in an R or RStudio window).

## 2. What you’re seeing right now

This is a **minimal placeholder** UI (sidebar + main area). The full AutoML wizard (upload, configure, run, results) would look different; this is only to confirm the app runs and to evaluate layout and clarity.

## 3. Things to evaluate and report back

Answer in your own words and add anything else you notice.

| Area | What to check | Your notes |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **First impression** | Does the window look clear and professional? Any obvious clutter or confusion? | |
| **Title / branding** | Is “Sensehub AutoM/L” clear? Would you change the name or how it’s shown? | |
| **Layout** | Sidebar on the left, main content on the right — does this feel right for this kind of app? | |
| **Readability** | Is the text easy to read (size, contrast, spacing)? | |
| **Navigation** | (Placeholder has no steps yet.) When we add Upload → Configure → Run → Results, would you expect tabs, steps, or something else? | |
| **Responsiveness** | Resize the browser window. Does the layout adapt okay or break? | |
| **Accessibility** | Can you tab through the page? Does anything feel hard to use with keyboard or screen reader? | |
| **What’s missing** | What would you want to see first in the real app (e.g. “Upload data” button, short instructions)? | |

## 4. After you’re done

- Close the browser tab when you’re finished.
- To stop the app completely: close the R or RStudio window that’s running it, or press `Esc` in the R Console if you started it from RStudio.
- Send your answers (and any screenshots or extra comments) back so we can use them to improve the UI.
